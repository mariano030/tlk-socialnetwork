// need to build with "npm run build" (also to get bundle.js)

// src is going to be bundled by building

// src start.js ist the main and all other "leafs" are gonna land near this tree

//simple react snippets

// all bla="blabla" things in a tag will be added to the props-object e.g. <Greetee muffin="yummy" name={name} />

// state is the data that is beind constantly watched and updating will have consequences...

// class based components AND functional compnents

// AXIOS vs CSURF encounter:
// adds unique token of random characters to request
// to confirm post request is geniuine

// axios component that adds csurf token to requests is needed in
// react

// <React.Fragment></React.Fragments>
// <></>;

// react fragments can not use classes
// <React.Fragment> </React.Fragment>
// alternative syntax: <> </>
// use fragments if you want to add a complex thing
// without the extra div around it -

// use Link to not have acutal links (that make requests / reload)
// <Link to="/login"> Click here to login </>
// Link needs to be a child of hash router! (subelements are by definition)

// hash component accepts only one element - wrap multiple ones in div e.g.
// to link to anything with hash component use Link

// invalid csurf? was war das nochmal f√ºrn fehler
